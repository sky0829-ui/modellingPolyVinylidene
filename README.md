Python code for analytical modeling of the PVDF-TrFE material based on the experimental data 
# PVDF-TrFE Numerical Modeling and Simulation

This repository contains Python code for numerical modeling and simulation of PVDF-TrFE material properties and piezoelectric behavior. The code is designed to analyze the mechanical and electrical responses of the material based on experimental data.

## Features

- **Stress-Strain Simulation**: Plots the stress-strain curve for PVDF-TrFE under applied forces.
- **Piezoelectric Voltage Generation**: Simulates voltage output as a function of applied mechanical force.
- **Dynamic Voltage Response**: Models voltage response under harmonic excitation using a damped harmonic oscillator.
